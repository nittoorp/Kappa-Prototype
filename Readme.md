White Tie Dye which costs around $60.0. The user must shop for the medium sized tshirt.
Searching for the t-shirt by scrolling the page would require a lot of effort, attention and
time. So, we’ve added filters to filter out the desired product from the remaining
products, making it relatively easier.

is of “medium” size and costs around $60.0. User may stop at the payment page.

“Filter” icon and look for the filtering options in the dropdown menu.
3. Click on the “Price range” option and look for the “Price Filter” to slide out.

“Apply Filter”.

significantly reduced. Now click on the t-shirt and wait the “t-shirt page” to load.

“MED” which stands for “Medium”. You can see the option being highlighted with a

White” which costs $40.0. The user must use the search option provided in the website.
Searching for the T-shirt by scrolling the page would require a lot of effort, attention and
time. So, we’ve provided a search bar which allows by showing suggestions for the user using
the data in the website. As you see the product name is tough to remember and the dynamic
search option here makes the search very comfortable which is not available in the original
website. We have designed the prototype for the same.

c) Task 3:
Once the item is added to the cart the next step is to fill the information for the delivery.
But the information page in the original site will take anything as an input. The phone

input.

To help user understand which field are required and which are optional. Also, to raise
error if the constraints for a field are not satisfied.

enter the character ‘@’. If you enter just ‘@’ it will ask you to enter other part of
the email that comes after it.
2. The page clearly shows the fields that are required by using the most commonly
used notation ‘*’. The user should be able to relate to the other existing
websites to be able to learn fast which is a UX principle.
3. As, the email option is mandatory for the delivery, if user skips this field and
enters first name then he will be directed to the email field.
4. The phone number field is limited to 12 characters.

5. Then click on Ask Amy to minimize the box.
